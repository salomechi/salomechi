👋 Hi, I’m Salome Chitubila (MSc in Agricultural Economics)!

🔍 I’m passionate about continuous learning and exploring where I can make the most impact. I enjoy working flexibly on dynamic projects, embracing challenges that help me to grow both technically and personally whilst learning how to build solutions with confidence.

🌱 Currently, I’m diving into Backstage.io, learning how to best leverage it for my team’s success.

💡 I’m eager to contribute to my team’s development while honing my technical skills and expanding my expertise.

✨ Beyond tech-interests, I love learning new languages, exploring different cultures, and identifying flowers/plants—because growth happens in many forms!

Let’s connect and build something amazing together! 🚀
